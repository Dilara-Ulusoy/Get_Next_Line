The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
She sells seashells by the seashore.
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.
Sally sells sea shells down by the seashore.
I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream!
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
Life is like a box of chocolates; you never know what you're gonna get.
All's fair in love and war.
